The goal of this project is to learn about Progressive Web Applications.

### What are PWAs?
Web applications that run in the browser but behave and feel like a native mobile application. 
- Built using web technologies (Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML)
- They can be installed in a mobile device.
- They are accessed through via a web address and not the app store.
- They can be used offline.
- Can use push notifications.

### What are Service Workers?
Javascript files that run through a separate thread, they are a background process.
- Their job is to handle the app-like functionality.
- They listen to events which occur in the browser such as push notifications made from a server to the browser or fetch HTTP request made by the browser to get an image or CSS file.
- They do not have access to the DOM.
